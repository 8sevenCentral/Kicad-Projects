This test panel was designed with the intention to test a few things:

* How well does the LED shine through the soldermask-less sections
* Can the LEDs be soldered directly to the back of the front panel? 
* Touch sensor cabibility to be integrated with the Trill Touch Sensor - https://bela.io/products/trill/
