This module was designed for easier breadboarding by integrating various potentiometer values / LEDs / IO Jacks / and dupont pinheaders. 

Improvements that could make this module more functional:
* increase the number of dupont connections
* decrease the amount of potentiometers
* footprints for toggle switches needs update
* leds for power indication - something wrong
* 16pin eurorack power header on the face
* make the footprint of the module smaller
